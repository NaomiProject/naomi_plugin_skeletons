# The STT plugin converts an audio clip into a text transcription.
# When it is instantiated, it receives a name and a list of likely
# vocabulary words:
#    stt_plugin_info = plugins.get_plugin(
#        plugin_name,
#        category='stt'
#    )
#    stt_plugin_instance = stt_plugin_info.plugin_class(
#        'Name',
#        ["vocabulary", "words"],
#        stt_plugin_info
#    )
# The Name and vocabulary get stored in the self._vocabulary_name
# and self._vocabulary_phrases attributes respectively.
# The plugin also inherits the self._logger and self.gettext
# objects from plugin.GenericPlugin, and the self._vocabulary_compiled,
# self._vocabulary_path, self._samplerate and self._volume_normalization
# attributes from plugin.STTPlugin.
